# Breast Cancer Detection

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect breast cancer based on diagnostic data. The goal is to classify tumors as either malignant or benign, leveraging patterns in the data.

## Features

- **Dataset**: Diagnostic features for breast cancer analysis.
- **Algorithm**: Machine learning model for binary classification.
- **Implementation**: Includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` or install directly):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kartikeya-trivedi/Breast_cancer_detection.git
   cd Breast_cancer_detection
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_cancer_detection.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset structure and feature distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important features.
4. **Model Training**: Building a machine learning model for breast cancer classification.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance metrics.

## Results

- Accuracy: `98%`
- Other metrics can be updated based on evaluation results.
